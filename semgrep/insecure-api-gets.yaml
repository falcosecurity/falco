    message: >-
      The program calls a function that can never be guaranteed to work
      safely.
      Certain functions behave in dangerous ways regardless of how they are
      used. Functions in this category were often implemented without
      taking security concerns into account. The gets() function is unsafe
      because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input.
      An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized input to gets() and
      overflow the destination buffer.
