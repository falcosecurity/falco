# Add missing MITRE ATT&CK tags

## Summary
This is a proposal for adding missing MITRE ATT&CK tags to the existing Falco rules.

We put a spreasheet together with our proposal at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lK2luf4iuOHDJEZ9EGcv3DkuuHeyRJAfeBzQCu2AuUI that we opened up for discussion during the community calls ([1](https://hackmd.io/3qYPnZPUQLGKCzR14va_qg?view#2021-06-09), [2](https://hackmd.io/3qYPnZPUQLGKCzR14va_qg?view#2021-06-23), [3](https://hackmd.io/3qYPnZPUQLGKCzR14va_qg?view#2021-07-14), [4](https://hackmd.io/3qYPnZPUQLGKCzR14va_qg?view#2021-07-21)).

## Motivation
Existing MITRE ATT&CK tags are few and not too accurate so we are including new tags for Enterprise and for Containers. Tagging rules according to MITRE ATT&CK matrix is an important method of classification and will be useful for any user.
