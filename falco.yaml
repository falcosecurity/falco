# if it doesn't exist. If you want to customize the set of rules, add
# your customizations to falco_rules.local.yaml.
#
# The files will be read in the order presented here, so make sure if
# you have overrides they appear in later files.

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

outputs:
  rate: 1
  max_burst: 1000

#   - logging (alternate method than syslog):
