# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to receive

syscall_drop_failed_exit: false

# --- [Description]
#
# This is an index that controls the dimension of the syscall buffers.
# The syscall buffer is the shared space between Falco and its drivers where all the syscall events
# are stored.
# Falco uses a syscall buffer for every online CPU, and all these buffers share the same dimension.
# So this parameter allows you to control the size of all the buffers!
#
# --- [Usage]
#
# You can choose between different indexes: from `1` to `10` (`0` is reserved for future uses).
# Every index corresponds to a dimension in bytes:
#
# [(*), 1 MB, 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB]
#   ^    ^     ^     ^     ^     ^      ^      ^       ^       ^       ^
#   |    |     |     |     |     |      |      |       |       |       |
#   0    1     2     3     4     5      6      7       8       9       10
#
# As you can see the `0` index is reserved, while the index `1` corresponds to
# `1 MB` and so on.
#
# These dimensions in bytes derive from the fact that the buffer size must be:
# (1) a power of 2.
# (2) a multiple of your system_page_dimension.
# (3) greater than `2 * (system_page_dimension)`.
#
# According to these constraints is possible that sometimes you cannot use all the indexes, let's consider an
# example to better understand it:
# If you have a `page_size` of 1 MB the first available buffer size is 4 MB because 2 MB is exactly
# `2 * (system_page_size)` -> `2 * 1 MB`, but this is not enough we need more than `2 * (system_page_size)`!
# So from this example is clear that if you have a page size of 1 MB the first index that you can use is `3`.
#
# Please note: this is a very extreme case just to let you understand the mechanism, usually the page size is something
# like 4 KB so you have no problem at all and you can use all the indexes (from `1` to `10`).
#
# To check your system page size use the Falco `--page-size` command line option. The output on a system with a page
# size of 4096 Bytes (4 KB) should be the following:
#
# "Your system page size is: 4096 bytes."
#
# --- [Suggestions]
#
# Before the introduction of this param the buffer size was fixed to 8 MB (so index `4`, as you can see
# in the default value below).
# You can increase the buffer size when you face syscall drops. A size of 16 MB (so index `5`) can reduce
# syscall drops in production-heavy systems without noticeable impact. Very large buffers however could
# slow down the entire machine.
# On the other side you can try to reduce the buffer size to speed up the system, but this could
# increase the number of syscall drops!
# As a final remark consider that the buffer size is mapped twice in the process' virtual memory so a buffer of 8 MB
# will result in a 16 MB area in the process virtual memory.
# Please pay attention when you use this parameter and change it only if the default size doesn't fit your use case.

#
# `cpus_for_each_syscall_buffer`
#
# --- [Description]
#
# This is an index that controls how many CPUs you want to assign to a single
# syscall buffer (ring buffer). By default, every syscall buffer is associated to
# 2 CPUs, so the mapping is 1:2. The modern BPF probe allows you to choose different
# mappings, for example, 1:1 would mean a syscall buffer for each CPU.
#
# --- [Usage]
#
# You can choose between different indexes: from `0` to `MAX_NUMBER_ONLINE_CPUs`.
# `0` is a special value and it means a single syscall buffer shared between all
# your online CPUs. `0` has the same effect as `MAX_NUMBER_ONLINE_CPUs`, the rationale
# is that `0` allows you to create a single buffer without knowing the number of online
# CPUs on your system.
# Let's consider an example to better understand it:
#
# Consider a system with 7 online CPUs:
#
#          CPUs     0  X  2  3  X  X  6  7  8  9   (X means offline CPU)
#
# - `1` means a syscall buffer for each CPU so 7 buffers
#
#          CPUs     0  X  2  3  X  X  6  7  8  9   (X means offline CPU)
#                   |     |  |        |  |  |  |
#       BUFFERs     0     1  2        3  4  5  6
#
# - `2` (Default value) means a syscall buffer for each CPU pair, so 4 buffers
#
#          CPUs     0  X  2  3  X  X  6  7  8  9   (X means offline CPU)
#                   |     |  |        |  |  |  |
#       BUFFERs     0     0  1        1  2  2  3
#
# Please note that we need 4 buffers, 3 buffers are associated with CPU pairs, the last
# one is mapped with just 1 CPU since we have an odd number of CPUs.
#
# - `0` or `MAX_NUMBER_ONLINE_CPUs` mean a syscall buffer shared between all CPUs, so 1 buffer
#
#          CPUs     0  X  2  3  X  X  6  7  8  9   (X means offline CPU)
#                   |     |  |        |  |  |  |
#       BUFFERs     0     0  0        0  0  0  0
#
# Moreover you can combine this param with `syscall_buf_size_preset`
# index, for example, you could create a huge single syscall buffer
# shared between all your online CPUs of 512 MB (so `syscall_buf_size_preset=10`).
#
# --- [Suggestions]
#
# We chose index `2` (so one syscall buffer for each CPU pair) as default because the modern bpf probe
# follows a different memory allocation strategy with respect to the other 2 drivers (bpf and kernel module).
# By the way, you are free to find the preferred configuration for your system.
# Considering a fixed `syscall_buf_size_preset` and so a fixed buffer dimension:
# - a lower number of buffers can speed up your system (lower memory footprint)
# - a too lower number of buffers could increase contention in the kernel causing an
#   overall slowdown of the system.
# If you don't have huge events throughputs and you are not experimenting with tons of drops
# you can try to reduce the number of buffers to have a lower memory footprint

# Falco continuously monitors outputs performance. When an output channel does not allow

#
# The "output_timeout" value specifies the duration in milliseconds to wait before

# base_syscalls ! Use with caution, read carefully !
#
# --- [Description]
#
# With this option you are in full control of the set of syscalls that
# Falco will enable in the kernel for active tracing.

# All syscalls and events from each enabled Falco rule are activated
# even when choosing this option. This option allows you to define a
# set of base syscalls that will be activated in addition to the
# syscalls defined in the rules.
#
# You may ask yourself why do we need to activate syscalls in addition to the rules?
#
# Falco requires a set of syscalls to build up state in userspace. This is because for
# example when spawning a new process or creating a network connection more than one syscall
# is involved. Furthermore, properties of a process during its life time can be modified
# by syscalls. Falco takes care of this by activating more syscalls than the ones defined
# in the rules and by managing a smart process cache table in userspace.
# Processes are purged when a process exits.
#
# Looking back to what this option does, it activates all syscalls from the rules
# (including resolved macros) and the ones specified here.
#
# This puts the end user in the driver seat to tell Falco what it needs, but if not used correctly
# Falco logs may be incomplete or wrong or Falco won't work at all. This option however can be
# very useful to lower CPU utilization and allowing you to tailor Falco to specific environments
# according to your organization's threat model and cost budget.
#
# !!! When NOT using this option, Falco defaults to adding a static (more verbose) set of syscalls
# in addition to the rules system calls Falco needs for its state engine build-up and life-cycle management.
#
# `base_syscalls.repair` is an experimental alternative to Falco's default state engine enforcement.
# `base_syscalls.repair` is designed to be the most resourceful option to ensure Falco runs correctly
# while activating a most minimal set of additional syscalls. The recommendations listed in the suggestions
# section is effectively what `base_syscalls.repair` is doing in an automated manner. `base_syscalls.repair`
# can be used with an empty custom set.
#
# --- [Usage]
#
# List of system calls names (<syscall-name>) plus negative ("!<syscall-name>") notation supported.
#
# base_syscalls.repair: <bool>
# base_syscalls.custom_set: [<syscall-name>, <syscall-name>, "!<syscall-name>"]
#
#
# --- [Suggestions]
#
# Here are a few recommendations that may help you.
# Setting `base_syscalls.repair: true` automates these recommendations for you.
#
# Consider to at minimum add the following syscalls regardless of the syscalls used in the rules.
#
# [clone, clone3, fork, vfork, execve, execveat, close]
#
# This is because some Falco fields for an execve* system call are retrieved
# from the associated `clone`, `clone3`, `fork`, `vfork` syscall when spawning a
# new process. The `close` system call is used to purge file descriptors from Falco's
# internal thread / process cache table and should always be added when you have
# rules around file descriptors.
# (e.g. open, openat, openat2, socket, connect, accept, accept4 ... and many more)
#
# When network syscalls are used in rules we recommend to at minimum set
#
# [clone, clone3, fork, vfork, execve, execveat, close, socket, bind, getsockopt]
#
# It turns out that while you can log `connect` or `accept*` syscalls without the
# socket system call, the log however would not contain the ip tuples.
# For `listen` and `accept*` system calls you also need the `bind` system call.
#
# Lastly, if you care about the correct `uid`, `gid` or `sid`, `pgid` of a process when the
# running process opens a file or makes a network connection, consider adding the following syscalls:
#
# setresuid, setsid, setuid, setgid, setpgid, setresgid, setsid, capset, chdir, chroot, fchdir
#
# We recommend to only exclude syscalls, e.g. "!mprotect" if you need a fast deployment update
# (overriding rules), else remove unwanted syscalls from the Falco rules.
#
# Passing `-o "log_level=debug"` to Falco's cmd args during a dry-run will print the
# final set of syscalls to STDOUT.
