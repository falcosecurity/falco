# falco_rules.yaml ships with the falco package and is overridden with

# The files will be read in the order presented here, so make sure if

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

# Falco contains an embedded webserver that can be used to accept K8s
# Audit Events. These config options control the behavior of that
# webserver. (By default, the webserver is disabled).
#
# The ssl_certificate is a combination SSL Certificate and corresponding
# key contained in a single file. You can generate a key/cert as follows:
#
# $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
# $ cat certificate.pem key.pem > falco.pem
# $ sudo cp falco.pem /etc/falco/falco.pem

# Possible additional things you might want to do with program output:
#   - send to a slack webhook:
#         program: "jq '{text: .output}' | curl -d @- -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX"
#   - logging (alternate method than syslog):
#         program: logger -t falco-test
#   - send over a network connection:
#         program: nc host.example.com 80

# If keep_alive is set to true, the program will be started once and
# continuously written to, with each output message on its own
# line. If keep_alive is set to false, the program will be re-spawned
# for each output message.
#
# Also, the program will be closed and reopened if falco is signaled with
# SIGUSR1.
