# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass
# system call information. When falco detects that this buffer is
# full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
# the following actions:
#   - "ignore": do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
#   - "log": log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
#   - "alert": emit a falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
#   - "exit": exit falco with a non-zero rc.
#
# The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
# token bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds
# with a burst of 10 messages.

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

# The ssl_certificate is a combination SSL Certificate and corresponding

#
# $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
# $ cat certificate.pem key.pem > falco.pem
# $ sudo cp falco.pem /etc/falco/falco.pem

# Possible additional things you might want to do with program output:

#   - logging (alternate method than syslog):
#         program: logger -t falco-test
#   - send over a network connection:
#         program: nc host.example.com 80

# If keep_alive is set to true, the program will be started once and
# continuously written to, with each output message on its own
