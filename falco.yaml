# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass
# system call information. When Falco detects that this buffer is
# full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
# the following actions:
#   - ignore: do nothing (default when list of actions is empty)
#   - log: log a DEBUG message noting that the buffer was full
#   - alert: emit a Falco alert noting that the buffer was full
#   - exit: exit Falco with a non-zero rc
#
# Notice it is not possible to ignore and log/alert messages at the same time.
#
# The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
# token bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds
# with a burst of one message (by default).
#
# The messages are emitted when the percentage of dropped system calls
# with respect the number of events in the last second
# is greater than the given threshold (a double in the range [0, 1]).
#
# For debugging/testing it is possible to simulate the drops using
# the `simulate_drops: true`. In this case the threshold does not apply.

# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to receive
# the events (eg., system call information) in userspace.
#
# Anyways, the underlying libraries can also timeout for various reasons.
# For example, there could have been issues while reading an event.
# Or the particular event needs to be skipped.
# Normally, it's very unlikely that Falco does not receive events consecutively.
#
# Falco is able to detect such uncommon situation.
#
# Here you can configure the maximum number of consecutive timeouts without an event
# after which you want Falco to alert.
# By default this value is set to 1000 consecutive timeouts without an event at all.
# How this value maps to a time interval depends on the CPU frequency.

syscall_event_timeouts:
  max_consecutives: 1000

# Falco continuously monitors outputs performance. When an output channel does not allow
# to deliver an alert within a given deadline, an error is reported indicating
# which output is blocking notifications.
# The timeout error will be reported to the log according to the above log_* settings.
# Note that the notification will not be discarded from the output queue; thus,
# output channels may indefinitely remain blocked.
# An output timeout error indeed indicate a misconfiguration issue or I/O problems
# that cannot be recovered by Falco and should be fixed by the user.
#
# The "output_timeout" value specifies the duration in milliseconds to wait before
# considering the deadline exceed.
#
# With a 2000ms default, the notification consumer can block the Falco output
# for up to 2 seconds without reaching the timeout.

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.
