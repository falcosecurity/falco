# File(s) or Directories containing Falco rules, loaded at startup.
# The name "rules_file" is only for backwards compatibility.
# If the entry is a file, it will be read directly. If the entry is a directory,
# every file in that directory will be read, in alphabetical order.

# falco_rules.yaml ships with the falco package and is overridden with
# every new software version. falco_rules.local.yaml is only created
# if it doesn't exist. If you want to customize the set of rules, add
# your customizations to falco_rules.local.yaml.
#
# The files will be read in the order presented here, so make sure if
# you have overrides they appear in later files.

# Whether to output events in json or text

# Minimum log level to include in logs. Note: these levels are
# separate from the priority field of rules. This refers only to the
# log level of falco's internal logging. Can be one of "emergency",

# Minimum rule priority level to load and run. All rules having a
# priority more severe than this level will be loaded/run.  Can be one

# buffered. Defaults to true
buffered_outputs: true

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

# Also, the file will be closed and reopened if falco is signaled with

# Possible additional things you might want to do with program output:
#   - send to a slack webhook:
#         program: "jq '{text: .output}' | curl -d @- -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX"
#   - logging (alternate method than syslog):
#         program: logger -t falco-test
#   - send over a network connection:
#         program: nc host.example.com 80

# If keep_alive is set to true, the program will be started once and
# continuously written to, with each output message on its own
# line. If keep_alive is set to false, the program will be re-spawned
# for each output message.
#
# Also, the program will be closed and reopened if falco is signaled with
# SIGUSR1.
