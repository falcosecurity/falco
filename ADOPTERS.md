BAH offers a solution to internal developers to easily build DevSecOps pipelines for projects. This makes it easy for developers to incorporate Security principles early on in the development cycle. In production, Falco is used to verify that the code the developer ships does not violate any of the production security requirements. BAH [are speaking at Kubecon NA 2019](https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/UaWr/building-reusable-devsecops-pipelines-on-a-secure-kubernetes-platform-steven-terrana-booz-allen-hamilton-michael-ducy-sysdig) on their use of Falco.

* [Coveo](https://www.coveo.com/) - Coveo stitches together content and data, learning from every interaction, to tailor every experience using AI to drive growth, satisfy customers and develop employee proficiency. All Falco events are centralized in our SIEM for analysis. Understanding what is running on production servers, and the context around why things are running is even more tricky now that we have further abstractions with containers and orchestration systems. Falco is giving us a good visibility inside containers and complement other Host and Network Intrusion Detection Systems. In a near future, we expect to deploy serverless functions to take action when Falco identifies patterns worth taking action for.

* [Deckhouse](https://deckhouse.io/) - Deckhouse Platform presents to you the opportunity to create homogeneous Kubernetes clusters anywhere and handles comprehensive, automagical management for them. It supplies all the add-ons you need for auto-scaling, observability, security, and service mesh.
