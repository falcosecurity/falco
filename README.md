### Latest releases

Read the [change log](CHANGELOG.md).

<!-- 
Badges in the following table are constructed by using the
https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/xml endpoint.

Parameters are configured for fetching packages from S3 before 
(filtered by prefix, sorted in ascending order) and for picking 
the latest package by using an XPath selector after.

- Common query parameters:

color=#300aec7
style=flat-square
label=Falco

- DEB packages parameters:

url=https://falco-distribution.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?prefix=packages/deb/stable/falco-
query=substring-before(substring-after((/*[name()='ListBucketResult']/*[name()='Contents'])[last()]/*[name()='Key'],"falco-"),".asc")

- RPM packages parameters:

url=https://falco-distribution.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?prefix=packages/rpm/falco-
query=substring-before(substring-after((/*[name()='ListBucketResult']/*[name()='Contents'])[last()]/*[name()='Key'],"falco-"),".asc")

- BIN packages parameters:

url=https://falco-distribution.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?prefix=packages/bin/x86_64/falco-
query=substring-after((/*[name()='ListBucketResult']/*[name()='Contents'])[last()]/*[name()='Key'], "falco-")

Notes:
 - if more than 1000 items are present under as S3 prefix, 
   the actual latest package will be not picked;
   see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html
 - for `-dev` packages, the S3 prefix is modified accordingly
 - finally, all parameters are URL encoded and appended to the badge endpoint

---

The Falco Project, originally created by [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com), is an incubating [CNCF](https://cncf.io) open source cloud native runtime security tool.
Falco makes it easy to consume kernel events, and enrich those events with information from Kubernetes and the rest of the cloud native stack.
Falco has a rich set of security rules specifically built for Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud-native.
If a rule is violated in a system, Falco will send an alert notifying the user of the violation and its severity.

### Installing Falco

If you would like to run Falco in **production** please adhere to the [official installation guide](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/).

##### Kubernetes

| Tool     | Link                                                                                       | Note                                                               |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Helm     | [Chart Repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/falco#introduction) | The Falco community offers regular helm chart releases.            |
| Minikube | [Tutorial](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/third-party/#minikube)                                   | The Falco driver has been baked into minikube for easy deployment. |
| Kind     | [Tutorial](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/third-party/#kind)                                       | Running Falco with kind requires a driver on the host system.      |
| GKE      | [Tutorial](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/third-party/#gke)                                        | We suggest using the eBPF driver for running Falco on GKE.         |

### Developing

Falco is designed to be extensible such that it can be built into cloud-native applications and infrastructure.

Falco has a [gRPC](https://falco.org/docs/grpc/) endpoint and an API defined in [protobuf](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/userspace/falco/outputs.proto).
The Falco Project supports various SDKs for this endpoint.

##### SDKs

| Language | Repository                                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Go       | [client-go](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-go) |
| Rust     | [client-rs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-rs) |
| Python   | [client-py](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-py) |


### What can Falco detect?

Falco can detect and alert on any behavior that involves making Linux system calls.
Falco alerts can be triggered by the use of specific system calls, their arguments, and by properties of the calling process.
For example, Falco can easily detect incidents including but not limited to:

- A shell is running inside a container or pod in Kubernetes.
- A container is running in privileged mode, or is mounting a sensitive path, such as `/proc`, from the host.
- A server process is spawning a child process of an unexpected type.
- Unexpected read of a sensitive file, such as `/etc/shadow`.
- A non-device file is written to `/dev`.
- A standard system binary, such as `ls`, is making an outbound network connection.
- A privileged pod is started in a Kubernetes cluster.
