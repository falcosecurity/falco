# Change Log

This file documents all notable changes to Falco. The release numbering uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

## v0.12.0

Released 2018-09-11

## Major Changes

* Improved IPv6 Support to fully support use of IPv6 addresses in events, connections and filters [[#sysdig/1204](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1204)]

* Ability to associate connections with dns names: new filterchecks `fd.*ip.name` allow looking up the DNS name for a connection's IP address. This can be used to identify or restrict connections by dns names e.g. `evt.type=connect and fd.sip.name=github.com`. [[#412](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/412)] [[#sysdig/1213](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1213)]

* New filterchecks `user.loginuid` and `user.loginname` can be used to match the login uid, which stays consistent across sudo/su. This can be used to find the actual user running a given process [[#sysdig/1189](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1189)]

## Minor Changes

* Upgrade zlib to 1.2.11, openssl to 1.0.2n, and libcurl to 7.60.0 to address software vulnerabilities [[#402](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/402)]
* New `endswith` operator can be used for suffix matching on strings [[#sysdig/1209](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1209)]

## Bug Fixes

* Better control of specifying location of lua source code [[#406](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/406)]

## Rule Changes

* None for this release.

## v0.11.1

Released 2018-07-31

## Bug Fixes

* Fix a problem that caused the kernel module to not load on certain kernel versions [[#397](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/397)] [[#394](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/394)]

## v0.11.0

Released 2018-07-24

## Major Changes

* **EBPF Support** (Beta): Falco can now read events via an ebpf program loaded into the kernel instead of the `falco-probe` kernel module. Full docs [here](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/wiki/eBPF-(beta)). [[#365](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/365)]

## Minor Changes

* Rules may now have an `skip-if-unknown-filter` property. If set to true, a rule will be skipped if its condition/output property refers to a filtercheck (e.g. `fd.some-new-attibute`) that is not present in the current falco version. [[#364](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/364)] [[#345](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/345)]
* Small changes to Falco `COPYING` file so github automatically recognizes license [[#380](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/380)]
* New example integration showing how to connect Falco with Anchore to dynamically create falco rules based on negative scan results [[#390](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/390)]
* New example integration showing how to connect Falco, [nats](https://nats.io/), and K8s to run flexible "playbooks" based on Falco events [[#389](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/389)]

## Bug Fixes

* Ensure all rules are enabled by default [[#379](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/379)]
* Fix libcurl compilation problems [[#374](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/374)]
* Add gcc-6 to docker container, which improves compatibility when building kernel module [[#382](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/382)] [[#371](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/371)]
* Ensure the /lib/modules symlink to /host/lib/modules is set correctly [[#392](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/392)]

* New rule `Write below monitored directory` [[#366](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/366)]

## v0.10.0

Released 2018-04-24

## Major Changes

* **Rules Directory Support**: Falco will read rules files from `/etc/falco/rules.d` in addition to `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` and `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`. Also, when the argument to `-r`/falco.yaml `rules_file` is a directory, falco will read rules files from that directory. [[#348](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/348)] [[#187](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/187)]
* Properly support all syscalls (e.g. those without parameter extraction by the kernel module) in falco conditions, so they can be included in `evt.type=<name>` conditions. [[#352](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/352)]
* When packaged as a container, start building kernel module with gcc 5.0 instead of gcc 4.9. [[#331](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/331)]
* New example puppet module for falco. [[#341](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/341)] [[#115](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/115)]
* When signaled with `USR1`, falco will close/reopen log files. Include a [logrotate](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate) example that shows how to use this feature for log rotation. [[#347](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/347)] [[#266](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/266)]
* To improve resource usage, further restrict the set of system calls available to falco [[#351](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/351)] [[draios/sysdig#1105](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1105)]

## Minor Changes

* Add gdb to the development Docker image (sysdig/falco:dev) to aid in debugging. [[#323](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/323)]
* You can now specify -V multiple times on the command line to validate multiple rules files at once. [[#329](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/329)]
* When run with `-v`, falco will print *dangling* macros/lists that are not used by any rules. [[#329](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/329)]
* Add an example demonstrating cryptomining attack that exploits an open docker daemon using host mounts. [[#336](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/336)]
* New falco.yaml option `json_include_output_property` controls whether the formatted string "output" is included in the json object when json output is enabled. [[#342](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/342)]
* Centralize testing event types for consideration by falco into a single function [[draios/sysdig#1105](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1105)) [[#356](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/356)]
* If a rule has an attribute `warn_evttypes`, falco will not complain about `evt.type` restrictions on that rule [[#355](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/355)]
* When run with `-i`, print all ignored events/syscalls and exit. [[#359](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/359)]

## Bug Fixes

* Minor bug fixes to k8s daemonset configuration. [[#325](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/325)] [[#296](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/296)] [[#295](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/295)]
* Ensure `--validate` can be used interchangeably with `-V`. [[#334](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/334)] [[#322](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/322)]
* Rule conditions like `fd.net` can now be used with the `in` operator e.g. `evt.type=connect and fd.net in ("127.0.0.1/24")`. [[draios/sysdig#1091](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1091)] [[#343](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/343)]
* Ensure that `keep_alive` can be used both with file and program output at the same time. [[#335](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/335)]
* Make it possible to append to a skipped macro/rule without falco complaining [[#346](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/346)] [[#305](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/305)]
* Ensure rule order is preserved even when rules do not contain any `evt.type` restriction. [[#354](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/354)] [[#355](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/355)]

## Rule Changes

* Make it easier to extend the `Change thread namespace` rule via a `user_known_change_thread_namespace_binaries` list. [[#324](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/324)]
* Various FP fixes from users. [[#321](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/321)] [[#326](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/326)] [[#344](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/344)] [[#350](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/350)]
* New rule `Disallowed SSH Connection` detects attempts ssh connection attempts to hosts outside of an expected set. In order to be effective, you need to override the macro `allowed_ssh_hosts` in a user rules file. [[#321](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/321)]
* New rule `Unexpected K8s NodePort Connection` detects attempts to contact the K8s NodePort range from a program running inside a container. In order to be effective, you need to override the macro `nodeport_containers` in a user rules file. [[#321](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/321)]
* Improve `Modify binary dirs` rule to work with new syscalls [[#353](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/353)]
* New rule `Unexpected UDP Traffic` checks for udp traffic not on a list of expected ports. Somewhat FP-prone, so it must be explicitly enabled by overriding the macro `do_unexpected_udp_check` in a user rules file. [[#320](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/320)] [[#357](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/357)]

## v0.9.0

Released 2018-01-18

### Rule Changes

* Refactor the shell-related rules to reduce false positives. These changes significantly decrease the scope of the rules so they trigger only for shells spawned below specific processes instead of anywhere. [[#301](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/301)] [[#304](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/304)]
* Lots of rule changes based on feedback from Sysdig Secure community [[#293](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/293)] [[#298](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/298)] [[#300](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/300)] [[#307](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/307)] [[#315](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/315)]

## v0.6.0

Released 2017-03-29

### Major Changes

* Add the notion of tagged falco rules. Full documentation for this feature is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/draios/falco/wiki/Falco-Rules#rule-tags). [[#58](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/58)] [[#59](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/59)] [[#60](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/60)] [[#206](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/206)]
* Falco now has its own dedicated kernel module. Previously, it would depend on sysdig being installed and would use sysdig's `sysdig-probe` kernel module. This ensures you can upgrade sysdig and falco without kernel driver compatibility problems. More details on the kernel module and its installation are on the [wiki](https://github.com/draios/falco/wiki/Falco-Kernel-Module). [[#215](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/215)] [[#223](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/223)] [[#224](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/224)]
* When providing multiple rules files by specifying `-r' multiple times, make sure that you can override rules/lists/macros. Previously, a list/macro/rule specified in an earlier file could not be overridden in a later file. [[#176](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/176)] [[#177](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/177)]
* Add example k8s yaml files that show how to run falco as a k8s DaemonSet, and how to run falco-event-generator as a deployment running on one node. [[#222](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/222)] [[#225](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/225)] [[#226](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/226)]
* Update third party libraries to address security vulnerabilities. [[#182](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/182)]
* Falco can now be built on OSX. Like sysdig, on OSX it is limited to reading existing trace files. [[#210](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/210)]

### Minor Changes
* Several changes to [falco-event-generator](https://github.com/draios/falco/wiki/Generating-Sample-Events) to improve usability. [[#205](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/205)]
* Switch to a formatter cache provided by sysdig code instead of using our own. [[#212](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/212)]
* Add automated tests that use locally-built docker images. [[#188](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/188)]

### Bug Fixes

* Make sure output strings are not truncated when a given %field expression has a NULL value. [[#180](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/180)] [[#181](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/181)]
* Allow ASSERTs when running travisci tests. [[#199](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/199)]

* Add [exechealthz](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/exec-healthz), a k8s liveness checking utility, to the list of shell spawners. [[#190](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/190)]
* Eliminate FPs related to weekly ubuntu cron jobs. [[#192](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/192)]
* Allow shells spawned by ansible, and eliminate FPs when managing machines via ansible. [[#193](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/193)] [[#196](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/196)] [[#202](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/202)]
* Eliminate FPs related to use of other security products. Thanks to @juju4 for the useful rule updates. [[#200](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/200)]

* Add erl_child_setup as a shell spawner. Thanks to @dkerwin for the useful rule updates. [[#218](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/218)]  [[#221](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/221)]
* Add support for gitlab omnibus containers/pods. Thanks to @dkerwin for the useful rule updates. [[#220](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/220)]

## v0.5.0

Released 2016-12-22

Starting with this release, we're adding a new section "Rule Changes" devoted to changes to the default ruleset `falco_rules.yaml`.

### Major Changes

* Cache event formatting objects so they are not re-created for every falco notification. This can result in significant speedups when the ruleset results in lots of notifications. [[#158](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/158)]
* Falco notifications are now throttled by a token bucket, preventing a flood of notifications when many events match a rule. Controlled by the `outputs, rate` and `outputs, max_burst` options. [[#161](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/161)]

### Minor Changes

* When run from a container, you can provide the environment variable `SYSDIG_SKIP_LOAD` to skip the process of building/loading the kernel module. Thanks @carlsverre for the fix. [[#145](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/145)]
* Fully implement `USE_BUNDLED_DEPS` within CMakeFiles so you can build with external third-party libraries. [[#147](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/147)]
* Improve error messages that result when trying to load a rule with a malformed `output:` attribute [[#150](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/150)] [[#151](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/151)]
* Add the ability to write event capture statistics to a file via the `-s <statsfile>` option. [[#155](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/155)]
* New configuration option `log_level` controls the verbosity of falco's logging. [[#160](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/160)]


### Bug Fixes

* Improve compatibility with Sysdig Cloud Agent build [[#148](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/148)]

### Rule Changes

## v0.4.0

Released 2016-10-25

As falco depends heavily on sysdig, many changes here were actually made to sysdig and pulled in as a part of the build process. Issues/PRs starting with `sysdig/#XXX` are sysdig changes.

### Major Changes

* Improved visibility into containers:
** New filter `container.privileged` to match containers running in privileged mode [[sysdig/#655](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/655)] [[sysdig/#658](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/658)]
** New rules utilizing privileged state [[#121](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/121)]
** New filters `container.mount*` to match container mount points [[sysdig/#655](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/655)]
** New rules utilizing container mount points [[#120](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/120)]
** New filter `container.image.id` to match container image id [[sysdig/#661](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/661)]

* Improved visibility into orchestration environments:
** New k8s.deployment.* and k8s.rs.* filters to support latest kubernetes features [[sysdg/#dbf9b5c](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/commit/dbf9b5c893d49f945c59684b4effe5700d730973)]
** Rule changes to avoid FPs when monitoring k8s environments [[#138](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/138)]
** Add new options `-pc`/`-pk`/`-pm`/`-k`/`-m` analogous to sysdig command line options. These options pull metadata information from k8s/mesos servers and adjust default falco notification outputs to contain container/orchestration information when applicable. [[#131](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/131)] [[#134](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/134)]

* Improved ability to work with file pathnames:
** Added `glob` operator for strings, works as classic shell glob path matcher [[sysdig/#653](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/653)]
** Added `pmatch` operator to efficiently test a subject pathname against a set of target pathnames, to see if the subject is a prefix of any target [[sysdig/#660](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/660)] [[#125](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/125)]

### Minor Changes

* Add an event generator program that simulates suspicious activity that can be detected by falco. This is also available as a docker image [[sysdig/falco-event-generator](https://hub.docker.com/r/sysdig/falco-event-generator/)]. [[#113](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/113)] [[#132](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/132)]
* Changed rule names to be human readable [[#116](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/116)]
* Add Copyright notice to all source files [[#126](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/126)]
* Changes to docker images to make it easier to massage JSON output for webhooks [[#133](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/133)]
* When run with `-v`, print statistics on the number of events processed and dropped [[#139](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/139)]
* Add ability to write trace files with `-w`. This can be useful to write a trace file in parallel with live event monitoring so you can reproduce it later. [[#140](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/140)]
* All rules can now take an optional `enabled` flag. With `enabled: false`, a rule will not be loaded or run against events. By default all rules are enabled [[#119](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/119)]

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed rule FPs related to docker's `docker`/`dockerd` split in 1.12 [[#112](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/112)]
* Fixed rule FPs related to sysdigcloud agent software [[#141](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/141)]
* Minor changes to node.js example to avoid falco false positives [[#111](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/111/)]
* Fixed regression that broke configurable outputs [[#117](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/117)]. This was not broken in 0.3.0, just between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0.
* Fixed a lua stack leak that could cause problems when matching millions of events against a large set of rules [[#123](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/123)]
* Update docker files to reflect changes to `debian:unstable` docker image [[#124](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/124)]
* Fixed logic for detecting config files to ensure config files in `/etc/falco.yaml` are properly detected  [[#135](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/135)] [[#136](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/136)]
* Don't alert on falco spawning a shell for program output notifications [[#137](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/137)]

## v0.3.0

Released 2016-08-05

### Major Changes

Significantly improved performance, involving changes in the falco and sysdig repositories:

* Reordering a rule condition's operators to put likely-to-fail operators at the beginning and expensive operators at the end. [[#95](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/95/)] [[#104](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/104/)]
* Adding the ability to perform x in (a, b, c, ...) as a single set membership test instead of individual comparisons between x=a, x=b, etc. [[#624](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/624)] [[#98](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/98/)]
* Avoid unnecessary string manipulations. [[#625](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/625)]
* Using `startswith` as a string comparison operator when possible. [[#623](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/623)]
* Use `is_open_read`/`is_open_write` when possible instead of searching through open flags. [[#610](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/610)]
* Group rules by event type, which allows for an initial filter using event type before going through each rule's condition. [[#627](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/627)] [[#101](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/101/)]

All of these changes result in dramatically reduced CPU usage. Here are some comparisons between 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 for the following workloads:

* [Phoronix](http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/)'s `pts/apache` and `pts/dbench` tests.
* Sysdig Cloud Kubernetes Demo: Starts a kubernetes environment using docker with apache and wordpress instances + synthetic workloads.
* [Juttle-engine examples](https://github.com/juttle/juttle-engine/blob/master/examples/README.md) : Several elasticsearch, node.js, logstash, mysql, postgres, influxdb instances run under docker-compose.

| Workload | 0.2.0 CPU Usage | 0.3.0 CPU Usage |
|----------| --------------- | ----------------|
| pts/apache | 24% | 7% |
| pts/dbench | 70% | 5% |
| Kubernetes-Demo (Running) | 6% | 2% |
| Kubernetes-Demo (During Teardown) | 15% | 3% |
| Juttle-examples | 3% | 1% |

As a part of these changes, falco now prefers rule conditions that have at least one `evt.type=` operator, at the beginning of the condition, before any negative operators (i.e. `not` or `!=`). If a condition does not have any `evt.type=` operator, falco will log a warning like:

```
Rule no_evttype: warning (no-evttype):
proc.name=foo
     did not contain any evt.type restriction, meaning it will run for all event types.
     This has a significant performance penalty. Consider adding an evt.type restriction if possible.
```

If a rule has a `evt.type` operator in the later portion of the condition, falco will log a warning like:

```
Rule evttype_not_equals: warning (trailing-evttype):
evt.type!=execve
     does not have all evt.type restrictions at the beginning of the condition,
     or uses a negative match (i.e. "not"/"!=") for some evt.type restriction.
     This has a performance penalty, as the rule can not be limited to specific event types.
     Consider moving all evt.type restrictions to the beginning of the rule and/or
     replacing negative matches with positive matches if possible.
```


### Minor Changes

* Several sets of rule cleanups to reduce false positives. [[#95](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/95/)]
* Add example of how falco can detect abuse of a badly designed REST API. [[#97](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/97/)]
* Add a new output type "program" that writes a formatted event to a configurable program. Each notification results in one invocation of the program. A common use of this output type would be to send an email for every falco notification. [[#105](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/105/)] [[#99](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/99)]
* Add the ability to run falco on all events, including events that are flagged with `EF_DROP_FALCO`. (These events are high-volume, low-value events that are ignored by default to improve performance). [[#107](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/107/)] [[#102](https://github.com/draios/falco/issues/102)]

### Bug Fixes

* Add third-party jq library now that sysdig requires it. [[#96](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/96/)]

## v0.2.0

Released 2016-06-09

For full handling of setsid system calls and session id tracking using `proc.sname`, falco requires a sysdig version >= 0.10.0.

### Major Changes

- Add TravisCI regression tests. Testing involves a variety of positive, negative, and informational trace files with both plain and json output. [[#76](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/76)] [[#83](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/83)]
- Fairly big rework of ruleset to improve coverage, reduce false positives, and handle installation environments effectively [[#83](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/83)] [[#87](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/87)]
- Not directly a code change, but mentioning it here--the Wiki has now been populated with an initial set of articles, migrating content from the README and adding detail when necessary. [[#90](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/90)]

### Minor Changes

- Improve JSON output to include the rule name, full output string, time, and severity [[#89](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/89)]

### Bug Fixes

- Improve CMake quote handling [[#84](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/84)]
- Remove unnecessary NULL check of a delete [[#85](https://github.com/draios/falco/pull/85)]
