# File(s) or Directories containing Falco rules, loaded at startup.
# The name "rules_file" is only for backwards compatibility.
# If the entry is a file, it will be read directly. If the entry is a directory,
# every file in that directory will be read, in alphabetical order.
#
# falco_rules.yaml ships with the falco package and is overridden with
# every new software version. falco_rules.local.yaml is only created
# if it doesn't exist. If you want to customize the set of rules, add
# your customizations to falco_rules.local.yaml.
#
# The files will be read in the order presented here, so make sure if
# you have overrides they appear in later files.

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the

# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

# Falco contains an embedded webserver that can be used to accept K8s

# key contained in a single file. You can generate a key/cert as follows:
#
# $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
# $ cat certificate.pem key.pem > falco.pem
# $ sudo cp falco.pem /etc/falco/falco.pem

# Possible additional things you might want to do with program output:

#   - logging (alternate method than syslog):
#         program: logger -t falco-test
#   - send over a network connection:
#         program: nc host.example.com 80
